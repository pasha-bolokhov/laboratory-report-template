\section*{\textit{Purpose}}

	The purpose in no more than one sentence --- typically a laboratory tests a law or a principle,
	usually in the form of an equation (for example $ F ~=~ m a $).
	More rarely the goal of the laboratory is the acquaintance with 
	certain concepts (such as energy, momentum, force, voltage \emph{etc})


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                                                                              %
%                               P R O C E D U R E                              %

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{\textit{Procedure}}

	The most difficult part --- the core of understanding the laboratory.
	In at most four sentences show how the goal is achieved.
	For example, if the laboratory tests the law $ F ~=~ m a $,
	you briefly describe how you measure (or calculate) the force,
	and how you measure the acceleration.
	That is, you are independently experimentally measuring the left-- and right--hand sides 
	of the equation, and then check that they agree with each other.
	The \emph{results} are not discussed here.
	Use present tense for your discussion

\section*{\textit{Observations}}

	Here go the measurements.
	Data is most efficiently represented in the form of tables.
	However, before (or sometimes after) each table you need to explain what you were measuring.
	Each quantity must be assigned a \emph{unique} letter, and must be accompanied by
	the appropriate units, unless it is a part of a series of numbers, in which case
	only the last number will need the specification of units.
	Deep technical details are not necessary,
	but it must still be clear how each number was measured
	
\bigskip\noindent
	Example of a data table (which must be preceded by explanations),
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
%
\toprule
%
	Trial	&	$ F $ (\si{\newton})	&	$ a $ (\si{\metre\per\square\second})	\\[2mm]
%
\midrule
%
	1	&	7.88	&	3.80	\\[2mm]
	2	&	7.95	&	4.08	\\[2mm]
	3	&	8.20	&	4.14	\\[2mm]
	4	&	8.12	&	3.92	\\[2mm]
%
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	For the above measurements, we used the hanging mass $ m ~=~ \SI{2.0}{\kg} $.
	The heavier mass of the counter--weight was $ M ~=~ 5.0 \pm \SI{0.01}{\kg} $.
