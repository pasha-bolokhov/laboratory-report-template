\section*{\textit{Purpose}}

	The purpose in no more than one sentence --- typically a laboratory tests a law or a principle,
	usually in the form of an equation (for example $ F ~=~ m a $).
	More rarely the goal of the laboratory is the acquaintance with 
	certain concepts (such as energy, momentum, force, voltage \emph{etc})


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                                                                              %
%                               P R O C E D U R E                              %

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{\textit{Procedure}}

	The most difficult part --- the core of understanding the laboratory.
	In at most four sentences show how the goal is achieved.
	For example, if the laboratory tests the law $ F ~=~ m a $,
	you briefly describe how you measure (or calculate) the force,
	and how you measure the acceleration.
	That is, you are independently experimentally measuring the left-- and right--hand sides 
	of the equation, and then checking that they agree with each other.
	The \emph{results} are not discussed here.
	Use present tense for your discussion

\section*{\textit{Observations}}

	Here go the measurements.
	Data is most efficiently represented in the form of tables.
	However, before (or sometimes after) each table you need to explain what you were measuring.
	In doing so, it is also important to reference the data correctly.
	For instance, if the cart is the only moving object in the experiment, you could think
	that it would be obvious that $ v $ is the speed of the cart, and not of the sleigh of Santa Claus.
	However, scientifically, you cannot make an assumption that $ v $ would necessarily mean the speed
\begin{itemize}
\item
	each \emph{quantity} must come explained --- you cannot rely on the laboratory hand--out in assuming
	that it is obvious that $ v $ is the speed of the cart

\item
	each \emph{quantity} must be assigned a \emph{unique} letter --- $ v $, $ a $, $ m $, $ M $, $ R $ and so on

\item
	note here that, repetitive measurements of the same quantity do not need different letters

\item
	at the same time, if you have velocities of two or more objects, then you can differentiate
	them by putting subscripts $ v_1 $, $ v_2 $, $ v_\text{avg} $, $ v_\text{in} $, $ v_\text{fin} $ or capitalizing one of them

\item
	each quoted number, besides being assigned a letter, must be accompanied by the appropriate units

\item
	if there is a group of similar measurements, it is recommended to specify the units
	only once per group, like in the table below

\item
	note, again, that any algebraic \emph{letter} must come defined, \emph{i.e.} do not assume that $ F $ is force or $ P $ is pressure,
	unless you specifically say so

\item
	only mathematical and physical constants ($ \pi $, $ e $, $ g $ and so on) do not need explanation, unless a confusion can be made
\end{itemize}
	Deep technical details are not necessary,
	but it must still be clear how each number was measured
	
\bigskip\noindent
	Example of a data table (which must be preceded by explanations),
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
%
\toprule
%
	Trial	&	$ F $ (\si{\newton})	&	$ a $ (\si{\metre\per\square\second})	\\[2mm]
%
\midrule
%
	1	&	7.88	&	3.80	\\[2mm]

	4	&	8.12	&	3.92	\\[2mm]
%
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	For the above measurements, we used the hanging mass $ m ~=~ \SI{2.0}{\kg} $.
	The heavier mass of the counter--weight was $ M ~=~ 5.0 \pm \SI{0.01}{\kg} $.

\section*{\textit{Calculations}}

	This is the \textit{Calculations} or \textit{Analysis} section.
	Short calculations can go into the \textit{Observations} section, if it makes sense.
	For instance, the calculation of the average speed or mass can be quoted
	in the \textit{Observations} section.
	You \emph{do not need} to explain how to calculate the average.
	However, more involved calculations need an explanation.
	A formula must be quoted whenever applicable

\bigskip\noindent
	We calculate the energy of Millennium Falcon according to the Einstein--Palpatine formula,
\[
	E  ~~=~~  \gamma\, m c^2,
\]
	where $ m $ is the mass of the spacecraft, $ c $ is the speed of light
	and $ \gamma $ is the relativistic factor.
	Using the values $ m ~=~ \SI{45000}{\kg} $, $ c ~=~ \SI{3.0d8}{\metre\per\second} $
	and $ \gamma ~=~ 1.4 $ we find
\[
 	E ~=~ \SI{5.7d21}{\joule}.
\]
	We expect therefore, the gravitational warp drive to be the most effective
	when the spacecraft has already exited into the hyperspace

\bigskip\noindent
	Repetitive calculations must be gathered into a result table,
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
%
\toprule
%
	Spacecraft	&	$ m $ ($\times 10^3\,\si{\kg}$)	&	$ R $ (kiloparsec)	\\[2mm]
%
\midrule
%
	Millennium Falcon	&	45	&	1.6	\\[2mm]
	Radiant VII		&	620	&	2.1	\\[2mm]
	Rogue Shadow		&	58	&	1.7	\\[2mm]
	CR90 Corvette		&	440	&	2.4	\\[2mm]
%
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
	Here $ m $ is the gross relativistic mass of the spacecraft, and $ R $ is the optimal shot range

\bigskip\noindent
	Error analysis also belongs here.
	However, if this analysis is quite short, it can be moved to Conclusion section
	if this makes more sense

\section*{\textit{Conclusion}}

	Up to six sentences discussing the results.
	Have you succeeded to test the law that you claimed in \emph{Procedure} section?
	In essence, you are answering whether the left--hand side come out equal to the right--hand side of the equation,
	but in physical terms.
	If the laboratory involved learning physical or mathematical concepts, you can comment on whether
	you were successful in that

\bigskip\noindent
	If the measurements or the outcome of the laboratory did not lead to the agreement of the experiment
	with a physics law, you need to address it, by discussing possible sources of error.
	Do not spend more than two sentences for a given equation or law
